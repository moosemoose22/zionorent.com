        Color film is a medium which is mostly in the history books. There are many reasons why the digital has supplanted color film as the medium people use for general photography. I thought it'd be interesting to compare digital and film prints to see how they stack up against each other.

        One important point is that digital and film differ in their dynamic range. Dynamic range is the difference between the lightest part of the scene that the camera can record and the darkest part of the scnene that the camera can record. The human eye had a much wider dynamic range that any of these mediums. This means that we can see more brights and darks in a scene than either film or digital can record.

        The following photos were taken for my night photography project in our color darkroom class at <a href="http://www.nesop.edu" target="top" class="reg">NESOP</a>. I first photographed them digitally to know the settings that I wanted for the film camera. Then I took the exact same photo with film. The film was probably Kodak Portra ISO 400 film. If I took a photo under strong artificial light I added a blue cooling filter to the film camera. This meant that instead of having a photo that looked super yellow, it'd just look normal. My camera was a Nikon FE.

        One could argue that many of the film photos have more emotion. The inability to capture some of the darker areas adds emotion to the photos. One could also argue that the digital photos are simply much clearer and crisper. My hope is to put forth this comparison so that people can have a better idea for themselves as to the differences between the mediums.

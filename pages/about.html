<p class="regText alignLeft">During the day I do computer stuffs. The rest of the time I'm trying to find time for a variety of photo projects, including documentary photography, events, digital darkroom projects, and photo books.</p>

<p class="regText alignLeft">I studied at the <a class="reg" target="top" href="http://www.nesop.edu">New England School of Photography</a> in Boston. In some ways it feels like I never left, as I continue to build on what I learned there and on the awesome experiences with the awesome people there.</p>

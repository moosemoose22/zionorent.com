		Once upon a time, people took photos with color film.
		The color darkroom allowed you to take color negatives and adjust them to your exact color preferences.
		I printed the scanned prints below for my final in The Color Experience, our crash-course in color darkroom.
		<!--You enter a room, set the Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow in the print, and expose the paper.
		Then you bring it in a light-free box to the printer, where it prints in around 4 minutes.
		You look at the resultant print, adjust color settings, and do it again until your print has correct color.-->
